# Verify-Verdict.ps1 -- recompute a landed verdict's body hash and compare it to the
# hash its own header claims.
#
# WHY: Land-Verdict.ps1 stamps a SHA-256 of the verbatim body into the header. A hash
# nobody can check is decoration, and this repo's rule is that a guard is unproven
# until someone has watched it fire. This is the checker, and it exists so the
# "extracted verbatim, not retyped" claim on every file in docs/reviews/ is testable
# rather than asserted.
#
# It answers exactly one question: has the body been edited since it was landed?
# Editing a verdict of record is not a formatting choice -- a review verdict is the
# other party's words, and the party landing it is the party being reviewed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/Verify-Verdict.ps1 -Path docs/reviews/<file>.md
#   scripts/Verify-Verdict.ps1            # verifies every file in docs/reviews/
#
# Exit 0 if every checked file matches; 1 if any mismatch or unparseable header.
#
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatible: no ternary, no &&/||, ASCII only.
