# Land-Verdict.ps1 -- extract a dispatched agent's verdict VERBATIM from the session
# transcript and land it in docs/reviews/.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the class, not the instance):
#
# A dispatch's output is ephemeral by default. The verdict lives in a session
# transcript nobody reads, and the only thing standing between an artifact and
# oblivion is the conductor remembering to copy it out -- which is VIGILANCE, the
# weakest tier in the Healing Loop's hierarchy, below even a written procedure.
#
# Entire.io already solves DURABILITY: every session is checkpointed to a public
# branch. What it does not solve is ADDRESSABILITY. A verdict buried in a
# multi-megabyte JSONL is safe and unusable, while README.md promises "review
# verdicts and REJECT records committed in-repo as they happen" -- a promise a
# reader cannot navigate to. Persisted-but-unfindable is not kept.
#
# And the obvious manual fix is worse than the gap. On 2026-07-22 the conductor
# began hand-transcribing a review verdict about its OWN design into docs/reviews/.
# That is a hand-maintained mirror at a process boundary -- the exact scar class in
# CLAUDE.md -- with the aggravating factor that the author being reviewed was doing
# the copying. A softened phrase or a dropped finding would be undetectable.
# VERBATIM-BY-CONSTRUCTION BEATS VERBATIM-BY-DISCIPLINE.
#
# So: this script reads the transcript, the conductor never retypes, and the landed
# file carries a SHA-256 of its own body so the verbatim claim is checkable rather
# than asserted.
#
# SOURCES, in preference order:
#   1. The live Claude Code session transcript (current, includes this turn).
#   2. An Entire.io checkpoint blob on entire/checkpoints/v1 (durable, may lag one
#      checkpoint behind).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/Land-Verdict.ps1 -TaskId <id> -Out docs/reviews/<file>.md `
#       -Title '...' -Gate '...' -Target '...' -Base <sha> -Verdict 'REJECT' [-Round 2]

#
# The first version hashed only the verbatim body, on the theory that the body is
# what must not be altered. An adversarial reviewer fault-injected it: change the

# and the verifier reported OK with exit 0. A file asserting APPROVE over a body
# arguing REJECT passed its own integrity check.
#
# That is the worst shape a guard can have here: the header is what a reader skims

# and left the claim everyone reads unprotected. Law 6 - the header was a second copy
# of the body's verdict with nothing checking they agree.
#
# Now the hash covers everything after the integrity line itself, so the only edit it
# cannot detect is a deliberate re-stamp. That is not a gap this mechanism can close:
# the conductor owns the producer, the hash function and the verifier. The real
# defence against a determined conductor is PUBLICATION - Entire's checkpoint branch
# holds an independently-written copy of the same body - and the hash's honest job is
