# Repo-policy check patterns - mechanical guards for documentation truth, sanitized

Status: Current

Provenance: the ancestor runs these as a CI job ("repo policy") beside build-and-test.
For a repo whose north star is documentation-ranks-equal-to-code, these are the
graduation path from review-attention to mechanism (the Healing Loop prefers a check
that fires at CI over a reviewer who must remember). Build them when setup.md's CI
trigger fires; shapes below.

## 1. The Status-line gate (docs carry their own liveness)

Every file under `docs/` carries a first-lines `Status: <word>` from a closed set:

- `Current` - true now; a stale claim in a Current doc is a defect.
- `Done` - a completed record (a landed plan, a closed audit); historical by nature.
- `Superseded` - kept for provenance; points at its successor.
- `Open` - a draft/working doc; claims not yet gated.

The checker: walk `docs/**`, regex `^Status: (Current|Done|Superseded|Open)` in the
first N lines, fail CI listing every violator. Scar: the regex is deliberately anchored
and plain - a decorated `**Status:**` header once passed human eyes and failed the
gate, and the fix was fixing the DOC to the machine-checkable form, not loosening the
regex. The lesson ported: keep the marker so simple a machine can hold it, and never
soften the checker to accommodate drift.

**Scope it deliberately, and record the scope.** The checker walks PROSE documents. Files
with required machine-read frontmatter - agent definitions, workflow YAML - are a different
artifact class, and a Status line would break their parse. Excluding them is SCOPE; loosening
the regex to let a decorated header through is DRIFT. In a diff those two look identical and
are opposites, so write down which one you did and why, or the next reader takes your
exclusion as permission.

What this buys the doc north star: "documents are living" needs a mechanical floor -
the Status line is each document declaring which truth-standard it accepts being held
to, and CI holds every one of them to it on every push.

## 2. The config-truth reconciliation (documented vs read)

Shape: enumerate every config/env variable the CODE reads (grep for the accessor
pattern - `process.env.X`, `config.get('x')`); enumerate every variable the DOCS
document (the setup/deploy guides' tables); fail CI on the symmetric difference, with
a small explicit allowlist for intentional gaps (each allowlist entry carries a
comment saying why).

Scar class: undocumented variables are invisible knobs (the stranger cannot deploy
what they cannot see - Law 7); documented-but-unread variables are lying documentation
(the reader sets them and nothing happens - Law 1). Both directions matter; checking
only one lets the other rot.

## 3. The citation checker (aspirational tier - build when citations accumulate)

Docs here cite `file.ts:123` heavily. A checker that parses citations from
`docs/**` and verifies the file exists (cheap tier) and the cited line's content still
matches a recorded fragment (expensive tier) converts citation-truth review work into
mechanism. The ancestor runs this check as reviewer attention (every adversary opens
every citation); the mechanical form is this repo's chance to graduate it. Honest
caveat from the severity philosophy: line numbers drift on every edit above them - the
cheap tier (file exists + symbol named exists in file) avoids crying wolf; the
expensive tier needs content-anchoring (cite `file.ts#symbolName` not raw line
numbers) before it can be strict without being noisy. An instrument that cries wolf is
worse than no instrument.

## Running them

One CI job, fail-fast, each check a small pure module with its own unit tests (the
checkers are code; they get the code standard). Local run before push:
`npm run policy`. The job is a REQUIRED check on PRs to main - a policy red is a real
red, not advisory (advisory checks decay into wallpaper; give the guard binding
authority - the Healing Loop, step 3).
